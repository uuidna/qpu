// THE DEPOSIT DOOR IS A SERVICE BINDING, NOT A TOKEN (the captain, 2026-09-14: deposits through the MCP door, "no token
// on host"). uuidna's Worker binds this entrypoint (wrangler [[services]] entrypoint = "QpuDeposit") and hands its
// deposit to the MCP door; Cloudflare routes no public request to a named entrypoint's methods, so the binding is the
// credential. It writes through the same qpuStorageOf every storage write uses — the same key form, inode and
// referrer — marked via: 'binding', which only this method sets. It lives here, in the Workers entry, because
// cloudflare:workers exists only inside the Workers runtime; the unit's Node tests never load it.
