/** COORDINATED DECENTRALISED INTELLIGENT JOBS. A job of `total` units splits across `agents` with no coordinator: each
 *  agent computes its own slice from its index alone (the first r agents carry one unit more), so the split needs no
 *  registry — the chat's lane arithmetic applied to work. The agents coordinate their result in ⌈log₂ agents⌉ reduce
 *  rounds by doubling, at a cost of 2(agents − 1) messages. The intelligence is in the count: too few agents and the
 *  work dominates, too many and the coordination does; the optimum is the agent count that maximises the speedup, and
 *  there — as split.kelvin and split.free show — the milliKelvin per unit is least and the free energy most. Every
 *  formula is a natural of naturals, each a hex program at its address on the one door. */
