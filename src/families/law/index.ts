/** THE COURT TOOLKIT AS FORMULAS — ANY CASE, ANY JURISDICTION, NO ADVICE UNTIL REVIEWED. What a clerk computes in any
 *  court is arithmetic over the numbers that jurisdiction supplies: a limitation period in days, a filing deadline from
 *  a start day, a quorum and a majority or super-majority of a body, a notice period met or not. These are exact and
 *  jurisdiction-agnostic — you pass the jurisdiction's own years, percentages and counts. None of it is legal ADVICE:
 *  `reviewed(confirmed)` is the gate — a computed conclusion holds as advice only once a legal review has confirmed it
 *  TRUE against the authoritative document (data.law reads the court-accepted source). Until then every result is a
 *  lead, computed and receipted, never asserted as counsel. Run them in waves (split.kelvin → 0): time split, no heat. */
