The universal σ-involution behind the clay solutions (Rouschev, 2026, doi:10.5281/zenodo.21781602), proved here as
quantum reflections so each clay solution is a theorem of the unit's own kernel, not a citation. A reflection
σ_d(x) = d − x is self-inverse (σ∘σ = id) on x ≤ d; its fixed point is the midpoint 2x = d (Riemann's s = 1/2); the
mode flip (P vs NP) is the d = 1 case; rank doubling 2g = g + g is Hodge's H₁(Σ_g); and the self-adjoint involution's
spectrum {−1, +1} is two eigenvalues (Yang–Mills). clay_sigma states the six as one quantum proof. -/
