 *
 * So the first timeout is paid and the rest are not: while a host is marked silent, its doors return the miss

 * one per ask, which is a number a caller can reason about, and on Cloudflare it stops a dead upstream from
 * spending a request's fifty subrequests on silence.
 *
 * ONLY A TIMEOUT OPENS IT, NEVER A REFUSAL. A refused connection is already cheap and is often transient — a

 * Seven identities were restated inline about sixty-six times across this file — `faces.faces === coins *
 * faces.rays` nine times, `next === fused + fused` eighteen, `coil === faces` fifteen, each with a different
 * receiver and none of them saying which theorem it was. Every restatement is a place the identity can be typed
 * wrong and go on passing, and a place a reader has to re-derive what they are looking at. The Lean file is the
 * authority for the statement AND for the name, so each identity has exactly one mirror here.
 *
 * This is the rule the build already applies across the language boundary — emit() requires a js: mirror beside
 * every lean: statement and hard-fails when the two disagree — turned inward on the file's own arithmetic. A
 * mirror that exists once can disagree with Lean once; sixty-six copies can disagree sixty-six ways.
 *
 * Operands are passed rather than closed over, because the sites hold these quantities under a dozen different
 * receivers (faces.faces, c.lattice.faces, p.coil.faces) and a mirror that reached for module state would be
 * checking something other than what the caller has in hand.

   * facts — it derives one from the other, and the derivation is the interesting part:

   *   theorem harmonic : faces = rays + rays := by rw [around, coins_two, Nat.two_mul]
   *
   * faces = rays + rays is proved FROM faces = coins * rays, and what carries it across is coins = seed + seed.
   * The bridge is doubling: a product by two and a sum with itself are the same operation seen from either side.
   *
   * mintOf_add is the general form of that bridge — mintOf (a + b) = mintOf a * mintOf b — and it is why the cube
   * can be read either way: bits = n + coins additively, bits = vertices * hexbit multiplicatively, the same 32.
   *
   * And the two forms COINCIDE at exactly one value. x + x = x * x only at x = 0 and x = 2, and x + x = mintOf x
   * only at x = 2 — so coins is the one place where the symmetric and asymmetric readings of a quantity are the
   * same number. That is not decoration: it is why a lattice built on coins can be read both ways at all, and it
   * is the reason theorem tetra and theorem dense both hold while neither generalises.

 * Five of the eight carried the identical description — "theorem shor. Factor 91." — so tools/list could not tell
 * crypto_iqft from crypto_shots, and the README's Claim column was a tag repeated seven times rather than a
 * reading. A claim that is the same for every door claims nothing about any of them.
 *
 * The distinguishing words already existed one field over, in each tool's long man text. What was missing was the
 * RUN: the factors, the base, the way the factoring was reached. These are read from qpuShorOf and folded once,
 * so the table the README prints is a receipt of this build and not a label anybody typed.
 *
 * EACH IS A READING, NOT A VERB, AND THE GATE INSISTED ON IT. The first attempt opened with "Factors 91 into 7
 * and 13", and the prose gate drained it: a man page renders `crypto_shor — Factors ...`, which reads as a claim
 * that the door factors cryptographic moduli rather than as the number this run reached. "91 = 7 * 13, reached by
 * period" says the same arithmetic and claims nothing about what could be broken with it.

 *  pinned. Its per-character step was `x = xorOf(x + x, ...)`: xor and doubling only, an AFFINE map over GF(2) with
 *  no carry between bit positions, so distinct inputs cancel wholesale — 500 distinct short receipts addressed to 70
 *  distinct addresses, a 430-way loss. The doubling was also unbounded: past 2^53 `Number(bigint)` rounds the low
 *  bits away (an 8-character value addressed with 22 of its 32 digits zero, a 40-character one with 29), and past
 *  2^1024 the float reaches Infinity and BigInt(Infinity) THROWS — which is why every deposit over about a kilobyte
 *  failed outright, the whole uuidna ledger among them.
 *
 *  So the address is now the FNV-1a fold this file already trusts for its receipts (qpuFoldOf), at the width the cube
 *  declares: multiplication by the prime carries between bit positions, which is exactly what the old step lacked,
 *  and the arithmetic stays in BigInt, so it is exact at every length and never leaves the range. FNV-1a is a
 *  non-cryptographic fold: it separates content and is tamper-EVIDENT, and it is not collision-RESISTANT against an

     * two of them, the inode and the referrer. The file already said so ("sixty for the inode-and-referrer pair a
     * deposit makes") and treated it as a latency note. It is not: Cloudflare allows fifty subrequests per request
     * on the free plan, so the tail of the second put is refused, and the live host has been carrying feed records
     * with faces 7, 8 and 9 absent — stable across a minute of polling, a different record each time the store
     * grows. Reproduced here by refusing exactly those faces: "12 of 15 slots placed; face 7, face 8, face 9 did
     * not (Too many subrequests)".
     *
     * REPORTED, NOT SWALLOWED, AND NOT A CRASH EITHER. put now names the slots that did not land, and a refusal
     * belongs in the same shape as every other refusal this door makes — holds false with a reason — rather than
     * escaping as an unhandled rejection the caller reads as a 500.
     *
     * This does not make the write fit. Reducing sixty slots to something under the budget is a question about
     * whether a referrer — a pointer of four fields — needs its own fourteen RAID shares, and that is a change to
     * what RAID means here, not a bug fix. Named rather than guessed at.

     * the inverse of raidStripeOf or it is not, and which one is decided by the two functions and the text alone.
     * The store is never consulted. A write could land nowhere, or land corrupted, and this still said true; a
     * write of the same bytes to a broken store says exactly what a write to a healthy one says. The answer was
     * already in the input, which is the one thing a holds here is not allowed to be.
     *
     * It was not free either. It was O(value) on the write path — an earlier pass cut it from three times to
     * once per write without asking whether once was the right number.
     *
     * One sample per write also proves less than it looks. What matters about the striping is that it inverts for
     * EVERY length, and dealing into rays only behaves differently by length modulo rays — so the property is a
     * cross product of residue class against ray count, and the suite walks it (raid.test.ts). A write that

/**
 * WHY THE SHIMS REFUSE, NAMED ONCE FOR ALL OF THEM.
 *
 * Every refusal below is a CONSEQUENCE and not a policy, and the difference is the whole difference between a
 * computed answer and somebody's preference wearing a proof's clothes. A caller told `denied` without being
 * told by what has been handed a verdict rather than a reason.
 *
 *   ABSENT INPUT — `js`, `path`, `mod`, `worker`, `job`, `key`. There is no answer to compute, which is
 *   theorem false: a claim with nothing under it is refused rather than answered, and the third state this
 *   package keeps everywhere says an undecidable question is not a false one. Fabricating a default here
 *   would be the unit answering a question nobody asked.
 *
 *   BOUNDS — `heap`, `depth`, `slots`. Every one is a lattice quantity rather than a number somebody chose:
 *   the byte ceiling is found * faces, the recursion ceiling is mintOf(n), the seats are faces. theorem cube
 *   and theorem clay fix those, so the bound is derivable and a reader can check it against the geometry
 *   instead of taking it on trust.
 *
 *   THE SEALED NAMES — `unlocked`, `quantum`, `mint`. A shim may not reach past what the sandbox seats, which
 *   is theorem names: a name the unit seeded is reserved, and the reply carries the free seat across the
 *   involution rather than a bare no.
 *
 * A refusal that fits none of these three has no theorem behind it and does not belong here — which is what
 * `npm run refusals` counts, and the count may only fall.

/**
 * SCHOOL SUBJECTS AND SCIENTIFIC DOMAINS: WHICH ARE ENTANGLED, DECIDED BY EVIDENCE RATHER THAN BY A TABLE.
 *
 * Sports, circus, theatre, music, arts and crafts are carried on a timetable as the practical subjects and are
 * the first line cut from a budget for being non-academic. The claim examined here is the opposite one: that
 * each is entangled with a scientific domain, and that the direction of discovery usually ran from the practice
 * to the theory rather than the other way.
 *
 * THE LATTICE ALREADY HOLDS THE RIGHT SHAPE. Fourteen faces are two teams of seven rays, and at coins = 2 the
 * involution restricted to seats IS the team swap. Seat subjects on one team and domains on the other and the
 * swap is a test rather than a decoration:
 *
 *   A subject and a domain are ENTANGLED when the swap is an identity on the pair — the domain can be taught
 *   through the subject AND the subject through the domain. When only one direction teaches it is not
 *   entanglement, it is APPLICATION.
 *
 * Radiocarbon dating serves history; history does not teach radiocarbon dating. One way, so: application.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT ALLOWED TO KNOW. Writing the pairs down as a table and seating them would make the
 * kernel already hold the answer, which is the fault this package refuses everywhere else — a measured-then-
 * sealed fact is furniture. So the input is INSTANCES: a cited, dated occasion on which one side taught the
 * other, in a named direction. Which pairs are entangled, which are merely applied, which are not decidable
 * here, and which seven end up seated are all computed from those instances and appear nowhere in them.
 *
 * Add an instance in a missing direction and an application becomes an entanglement. Add an earlier instance
 * and the seating moves. Remove the corpus and every pair reads UNDECIDED, which is the third state and means
 * NOT DECIDABLE HERE — never false, and never absent.

 * triangles and six squares.
 *
 * Neither number determines the other. INSPIRE may publish a tenth endpoint
 * without consulting geometry, and the cube does not care how CERN organises an
 * API. The identity held by coincidence and was written down as a law, which is
 * the fault this tree has already named twice: 12356d2, „the fold's radix and
 * its width were both a bare sixteen, and they are not the same quantity", and
 * 6cd77b4, „the exclusion I wrote asserted a limit without naming its cause".
 *
 * The cost was real. A fifteenth catalog could not be wired without displacing
 * a named one or moving `faces` — and `faces` carries the RAID share geometry,
 * where storage_monitor counts 245 keys × 14 = 3430 live shares. So the
 * question „is this source worth wiring?" became „which of the fourteen do you
 * sacrifice?", and the answer was to wire nothing.
 *
 * What is asserted now is what is actually true of a catalog list: every name
 * is distinct, every href is absolute, and there is at least one. Those hold at
 * fourteen and at fifteen, and they fail for the things that would really be
 * wrong — a duplicate door, or a relative href that resolves against whatever

   * gate and two CI runs, none of them about anything in this repository.
   *
   * The miss shape was already here, three lines up, describing exactly this outcome — the function knew how to
   * SAY unreachable and never got the chance. Every other reader in this tree keeps the same discipline: a
   * refusal is reported as a refusal, and it is the third state, distinct from a wrong answer. The bound is
   * explicit too, because a fetch with no deadline is a hang rather than a miss.
   *
   * THE DEADLINE IS tenOf(hexbit) — ten seconds — AND WAS THIRTY. A run asks this host five times over (prove,
   * then train, improve, compete and the sequence, each live), and a host that accepts the connection
   * and then says nothing costs the full deadline every time. At thirty that is a hundred and fifty seconds
   * against a hundred-and-twenty-second test budget: measured, the suite did not fail, it was CANCELLED, which
   * writes no receipt at all. Ten holds the worst case to fifty.
   *
   * Shortening it is only safe because the proof no longer moves when this host is missed — the fold covers the
   * rows that asked nobody, and a miss changes the reading rather than the proof. Under the old arrangement a
   * tighter deadline would have traded a hang for a red build; now it trades it for an honest unverified.

/**
 * ONE READING SHARED, AND A MISS IS A READING.
 *
 * This memo kept the answer only when it HELD, so every caller that followed a miss read the host again from
 * scratch. Four callers sit behind one prove — train, improve, compete, prove — each asking seventeen doors,
 * and the sequence adds more. Measured: 87 foreign reads when CERN answered, 205 when it did not. The failure
 * case cost two and a half times the network work of the success case, which is precisely backwards.
 *
 * Two consequences, one in each direction. On Cloudflare a request is capped at fifty subrequests, so an outage
 * multiplied the very thing the cap counts, and an unreachable host could deny a door that host has nothing to
 * do with. And under a host that accepts a connection and then says nothing, each re-reading costs the whole
 * deadline: on a CI runner the cern test passed its budget and was CANCELLED, which writes no receipt — caught
 * by `npm run outage` on the runner, having passed twice on a laptop that is twice as fast.
 *
 * A HELD READING IS KEPT; A MISS IS KEPT BRIEFLY. Caching a miss forever would let one blip poison a Worker
 * isolate for the rest of its life, which is why only successes were kept. Keeping it for the length of one
 * deadline bounds the re-reading to once per window while making the failure path no more expensive than the
 * happy one, and the next request tries the host again.

 *  and its AutoTest runs each test on the interpreter AND the emulator and checks the two agree. That equivalence

/**
 * THE SITE IS THE MCP, ONE HOST AT A TIME.
 *
 * Every page this zone serves is a door the MCP already describes, so the discoverability surface is not written
 * beside the tool table — it is COMPUTED FROM IT. qpuDocsOf().api is the seven-path guide; the discovery doors sit
 * off it; and the sitemap of any host is exactly the GET doors that host answers. Add a door and it is crawlable
 * the same deploy; remove one and it leaves the sitemap without anybody editing a list. That is the whole point of
 * building the site around the MCP rather than the other way around: there is no second list to forget.
 *
 * WHAT GOOGLE ACTUALLY REQUIRES, and what was measured missing on 2026-09-28:
 *
 *   PER HOST. robots.txt and sitemap.xml are read from the host that serves them; uuidna.com's pair says nothing
 *   about qpu.uuidna.com. Five of six first-party hosts answered 404 for both, so Cloudflare's managed default
 *   was served in their place — and that default names no sitemap, which leaves each one uncrawled as a site.
 *
 *   THE SITEMAP MUST BE POINTED AT. A sitemap with no `Sitemap:` line in robots.txt and no inbound link is
 *   discovered by nothing. qpu.uuidna.com HAS served a real sitemap at /sitemap.xml the whole time and nothing
 *   named it.
 *
 *   ONE CANONICAL ENDPOINT. Six hosts each advertising an MCP of their own are six duplicates competing for the
 *   same query. Every host here names the unit's single endpoint instead, so the crawl consolidates rather than
 *   splits, and a client that lands on any name is told where the door really is.

 * forge served from a memo would return a forge that did not happen. It stays out, and the epoch it advances
 * is what keeps the other three honest.
 *
 * AND NEITHER IS QPU_PROVE, WHICH WAS IN THIS SET FROM THE BEGINNING. It forges on every call — the epoch
 * advances each time it is asked — so a second identical request was being answered from the memo without
 * the forge happening. Two callers sending the same bytes got different effects, and the cached body
 * described a sandbox that the next forge would make wrong. Nothing noticed because the memo hid the
 * difference, and it only surfaced when the epoch entered the key and prove stopped hitting its own cache.
 * Correctness over the cache: it pays in full, and what it pays is now visible.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT ALLOWLIST IS THE SAFETY, not the tool list. `live` and `sequence` are absent from it, so a
 * call that reaches opendata.cern.ch can never be memoised however pure its door is — a cached reading of
 * somebody else's host is a lie with a timestamp. `team` is added because compete takes one and the
