// receipted — THE ONE DOOR EVERY TEST WALKS THROUGH. Standard (the captain, 2026-09-11): every test carries a
// computational receipt, and time and temperature are recorded beside it as READINGS. The receipt is the deterministic
// part: the fold of every amplitude vector the test produced and the count of every mintOf doubling; two honest runs
// fold to the same receipt. The readings are the measured part: the wall time of the test body in nanoseconds from the
// process clock, and a temperature — QPU_TEMPERATURE_MILLIKELVIN with its QPU_TEMPERATURE_SOURCE when supplied, else on
// macOS the battery gauge, named as such in its source, else unmeasured and said so. Readings never enter the fold and
// never enter src, so the served unit and the committed receipt carry no entropy; the reporter writes them to a sidecar.

 * ONE un-mirrored link turned every deploy red, including the deploy that would carry the repair. Three pushes
 * were blocked by it while the code that found it worked perfectly. A monitor that finds something and says so
 * is not a broken monitor, and the store's contents are not the build.
 *
 * The store fault belongs to `hostLeadsOf`, which already names it, its count and what it owes. What stays a
 * gate is whether the INSTRUMENT is sound, and that is this function: an instrument that stops noticing — a gap
 * in the shares with nothing reported missing — is a fault here, and so is one that notices and claims to hold
 * anyway. Both are properties of the code.
