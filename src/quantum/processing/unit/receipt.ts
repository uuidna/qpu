// receipt — THE SUITE'S RESULT AS COMPUTATIONAL RECEIPTS, PROOF APART FROM READINGS. Standard (the captain,
// 2026-09-11): every test carries a computational receipt; time and temperature are recorded beside it as
// readings; the receipt itself carries no entropy. Every test file imports `test` from ./receipted.js — the door that
// appends each test's ledger slice and readings to test-receipts.jsonl from inside the test process. This reporter
// folds that file into two artifacts:
//   test-receipt.json  — the PROOF: names, pass/fail, amplitude folds, mint chains, kinds. Deterministic; committed.
//   test-readings.json — the READINGS: wall time per test, temperature (measured or unmeasured, said which), every
//                        row that asked a host this tree does not own, and the
//                        cracks those readings name — an unresolved clock, an unmeasured thermometer. Gitignored.
// A top-level test with no computation, no mintOf call and no memo-served document is dry, and a dry test FAILS the
// run. Recomputable: re-run and the proof returns byte for byte.
//

  /**
   * THE PROOF FOLDS WHAT THIS TREE COMPUTED. WHAT A THIRD PARTY SAID IS A READING.
   *
   * The standard here is that two honest runs fold to the same receipt, and `npm run proof` enforces it by asking
   * git whether the file moved. That held for time and temperature, which were moved to readings on day one, and
   * it did not hold for the network.
   *
   * MEASURED, not argued. The suite was run with opendata.cern.ch forced into each of the four shapes a third
   * party actually fails in — connection refused, 503, a 200 carrying a captive portal's HTML, and a socket that
   * hangs to the deadline — and then three times in one fixed condition. Within a condition the fold is stable to
   * the byte. Across conditions exactly five of a hundred and sixty-two rows moved, and every one of them had
   * called a foreign door: when CERN answers, the readers build documents and mint doublings that a refused run
   * never builds. The receipt was not wrong; it was faithfully recording that less computation happened.
   *
   * So it cannot be both a fold of the computation performed and invariant under someone else's weather, and
   * `npm run proof` was asking for the second while the file delivered the first. It rejected two pushes that way,
   * naming this repository for something that had not happened here.
   *
   * The split is the three-state law applied to the receipt itself. A row that asked nobody is computed, and it is
   * the proof. A row that asked somebody records what that host did or did not say, which is not decidable here,
   * and it folds separately into `reading` — reported in full, gated by nothing. Both folds are written, so a run
   * that quietly stops reaching CERN is still visible; it simply is not a build failure.
   *
   * Served folds are on the reading side for the same reason, and dryness is judged before the split so a test
   * cannot escape the dry-clean by talking to a host instead of computing.
