// THE DATA DOOR'S FETCH RETRIES A TRANSIENT FAILURE, NOT A SETTLED ONE. A 5xx, a 429 (rate limit) or a dropped
// connection is a blip the next attempt may clear, so qpuGetOf retries it a few times with a short backoff within one
// deadline; a flaky public source no longer fails a whole lead feed. A 4xx below 429 is the client's own and fails
// fast — a real 404 is not worth another attempt. The fetch is stubbed so the contract is exercised without a network.
